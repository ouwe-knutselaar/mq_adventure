      \ monster?\nlet me tell you short about it's origins\nwebsphere mq is the market-leading\
      \ messaging integration middleware product. originally introduced in\n1993 (under\
      \ the mqseries name), it always focused on providing an available, reliable,\
      \ scalable, secure, and\nhigh-performance transport mechanism to address the\
      \ requirements that we discussed in the previous chapter.\nwebsphere mq always\
      \ connected systems and applications, regardless of the platform or environment.\
      \ it is\nessential to be able to communicate between a gui desktop applicationthat\
      \ is running on microsoft windows and\nan ibm cics® transaction that is running\
      \ on ibm z/os®. that value of universality is core to the product, and\nthis\
      \ value has not changed in all the time that it has been available. what has\
      \ changed is the range of\nenvironments in which websphere mq can or must live.\
      \ there are newer platforms, environments, requirements for\nqualities of service\
      \ (qos), and newer messaging patterns. security has become more important as\
      \ systems are made\naccessible to more users across an enterprise and beyond\
      \ it. performance and scalability requirements have\nincreased. regulators and\
      \ auditors have imposed more controls on what can or must be done. systems,\
      \ which\nneed access to enterprise data, have become bothmore powerful (faster,\
      \ more processors, and so on) and much\nless powerful (sensors, tablets,and\
      \ mobile phones).therefore, websphere mq has evolved.there are now more\nways\
      \ for applications to reach a websphere mq queue manager and toaccess any existing\
      \ applications that were\nalready websphere mq enabled. newapplications can\
      \ be written that use alternative interfaces and still maximize\nthe reliability\
      \ andperformance of websphere mq. those new applications do not need a completereplacement\
      \ of\nexisting infrastructure. the applications work with what you already have\
      \ andwhat you know how to manage.at the\nsame time as adding new interfaces,\
      \ protocols, and environments, a large amount ofthe websphere mq workload\n\
      continues to be executed in mainframe-based data centers.the efficient use of,\
      \ and integration with, the\ncapabilities of the ibm z hardware and operatingsystems\
      \ is critical. as this book shows, websphere mq v7.1\nfor z/os significantly\
      \ improvesthe performance, capacity, and availability that can be achieved when\
      \ running\nin a sysplexwebsphere mq v7.0, in 2008, was a major release with\
      \ significantly enhanced applicationprogramming\ninterfaces (apis) and a fully\
      \ integrated publish/subscribe component. theseenhancements made that messaging\n\
      pattern a first-class way of working. websphere mqv7.0.1, in 2009, was primarily\
      \ an update to improve\navailability and performance.even though there was nearly\
      \ a 2 ½ year gap before v7.1 in 2011, there were\nstillincremental improvements.\
      \ the improvements were to both the core websphere mq productand new products.\n\
      websphere mq file transfer edition is a solution for the integration of applications\
      \ that arefile-based,\nmaking it possible to reliably transfer files between\
      \ systems. websphere mq filetransfer edition provides\nmanagement, monitoring,\
      \ and security of those transfers.websphere mq file transfer edition uses existing\n\
      skills and infrastructure as it useswebsphere mq as its backbone transfer medium.advanced\
      \ message security (ams)\nis a solution to the problem of securing messagecontents,\
      \ even when those messages are at rest in queues or logs.\nseveral regulatoryframeworks\
      \ require data to be protected from viewing, changing, or being stored on disks\
      \ inthe\nclear even during processing. one example of these regulations is the\
      \ payment cardindustry (pci) for dealing\nwith credit card data. there are other\
      \ regulatory bodies for othertypes of data, for example, healthcare, that\n\
      have similar requirements.both websphere mq file transfer edition and websphere\
      \ mq advanced message securityhave\nbeen integrated into the websphere mq v7.5\
      \ package. websphere mq file transferfunctionally identical but that\nhave different\
      \ licensing terms. the websphere mq advancedoffering can be ordered under a\
      \ single part number\nand price and it includes licenses to usethe managed file\
      \ transfer and ams features. the original v7.5 offering\nhas these features\
      \ asseparately orderable and priced components.data is transferred between applications\
      \ in\nmessages. a message is a container that consistsof three parts: websphere\
      \ mq message descriptor (mqmd):\nidentifies the message and containsadditional\
      \ control information. examples of additional information are the\ntype of messageand\
      \ the priority that is assigned to the message by the sending application. message\
      \ properties:\nan optional set of user-definable elements that describes themessage\
      \ without being part of the payload.\napplications that receive messages canchoose\
      \ whether to inspect these properties. message data: contains the\napplication\
      \ data. the structure of the data is defined by theapplication programs that\
      \ use it, and\nwebsphere mq is largely unconcerned with itsformat or content.the\
      \ nodes, within a websphere mq message queuing\ninfrastructure, are called queuemanagers.\
      \ the queue manager is responsible for accepting and delivering\nmessages.multiple\
      \ queue managers can run on a single physical server or on a wide network of\
      \ serversacross a\nlarge variety of different hardware and operating system\
      \ platforms.each queue manager provides facilities for\nreliable messaging.the\
      \ queue manager maintains queues of all messages that are waiting to be processed\
      \ orrouted.\nqueue managers are tolerant of failures and maintain the integrity\
      \ of business-criticaldata that flows through\nthe message queuing infrastructure.\
      \ in the event of failures, such as afailure of the queue manager, machine\n\
      failures, or a power loss, messages can be recovered.recovery occurs when the\
      \ queue manager is restarted and\nany transactions are brought to aconsistent\
      \ state.the queue managers, within the infrastructure, are connected\nby logical\
      \ channels over acommunications network. messages automatically flow across\
      \ these channels from the\ninitialproducer of a message to the eventual consumer\
      \ of that message based on the configurationof the queue\nmanagers in the infrastructure.\
      \ changes can be made to the configuration ofqueues and channels transparently\n\
      for the applications. for example, a receiving applicationcan be moved to a\
      \ new machine, and a route to that\nmachine can be defined without needingany\
      \ changes to sending applications.two applications that must\ncommunicate, whether\
      \ hosted on the same machine or separatemachines, might have originally been\
      \ designed to do\nso directly and synchronously. this wasa common messaging\
      \ technique that was used before the introduction of\nwebsphere mqand is still\
      \ used often. for example, using http as a communications protocol is asynchronous\n\
      operation.in the synchronous model, the two applications exchange information\
      \ by waiting for thepartner\napplication to become available and then sending\
      \ the information. if the partnerapplication is unavailable for\nany reason,\
      \ including if it is busy communicating with otherapplications, the information\
      \ cannot be sent.all\nintercommunication failures that can occur between the\
      \ two applications must beconsidered individually by the\napplications. this\
      \ consideration happens whether theapplications are on the same machine or on\
      \ different\nmachines that are connected by anetwork. the process requires a\
      \ protocol for sending the information,\nconfirming receipt ofthe information,\
      \ and sending any subsequent reply.placing a websphere mq infrastructure\nbetween\
      \ the two applications allows thiscommunication to become asynchronous. one\
      \ application places\ninformation for the partnerin a message on a queue, and\
      \ the partner application processes this information\nwhen it isavailable to\
      \ do so. if required, it can then send a reply message back to the originator.\n\
      theapplications do not need to be concerned with communication failures or recovery.\
      \ a websphere mq client is\na lightweight component of websphere mq that does\
      \ not requirethe queue manager runtime code to reside on the\nclient system.\
      \ it enables an application,running on a machine where only the client runtime\
      \ code is installed,\nto connect to a queuemanager that is running on another\
      \ machine and perform messaging operations with thatqueue\nmanager. such an\
      \ application is called a client and the queue manager is referred toas a server.using\
      \ a\nwebsphere mq client is an effective way of implementing websphere mqmessaging\
      \ and queuing. the following\nbenefits are available by using a websphere mqclient:\
      \ there is no need for a licensed websphere mq server\ninstallation on the client\
      \ machine. hardware requirements on the client system are reduced. system\n\
      administration requirements on the client system are reduced. an application\
      \ that uses a websphere mq client\ncan connect to multiple queue managerson\
      \ different machines.there are several implementations of the\nwebsphere mq\
      \ client that allow work in differentlanguage environments, including java and\
      \ .net classes. there\nis no client for z/os. on the z/os platform, applications\
      \ can only connect to queue managers within the same\nlogicalpartition (lpar).\n\
