        Hello young novice, you came to defeat the Messaing Monster?
        Let me tell you short about it's origins
        WebSphere MQ is the market-leading messaging integration middleware product. Originally introduced in
        1993 (under the MQSeries name), it always focused on providing an available, reliable, scalable, secure, and
        high-performance transport mechanism to address the requirements that we discussed in the previous chapter.
        WebSphere MQ always connected systems and applications, regardless of the platform or environment. It is
        essential to be able to communicate between a GUI desktop applicationthat is running on Microsoft Windows and
        an IBM CICS® transaction that is running on IBM z/OS®. That value of universality is core to the product, and
        this value has not changed in all the time that it has been available. What has changed is the range of
        environments in which WebSphere MQ can or must live. There are newer platforms, environments, requirements for
        qualities of service (QoS), and newer messaging patterns. Security has become more important as systems are made
        accessible to more users across an enterprise and beyond it. Performance and scalability requirements have
        increased. Regulators and auditors have imposed more controls on what can or must be done. Systems, which
        need access to enterprise data, have become bothmore powerful (faster, more processors, and so on) and much
        less powerful (sensors, tablets,and mobile phones).Therefore, WebSphere MQ has evolved.There are now more
        ways for applications to reach a WebSphere MQ queue manager and toaccess any existing applications that were
        already WebSphere MQ enabled. Newapplications can be written that use alternative interfaces and still maximize
        the reliability andperformance of WebSphere MQ. Those new applications do not need a completereplacement of
        existing infrastructure. The applications work with what you already have andwhat you know how to manage.At the
        same time as adding new interfaces, protocols, and environments, a large amount ofthe WebSphere MQ workload
        continues to be executed in mainframe-based data centers.The efficient use of, and integration with, the
        capabilities of the IBM z hardware and operatingsystems is critical. As this book shows, WebSphere MQ V7.1
        for z/OS significantly improvesthe performance, capacity, and availability that can be achieved when running
        in a sysplexWebSphere MQ V7.0, in 2008, was a major release with significantly enhanced applicationprogramming
        interfaces (APIs) and a fully integrated publish/subscribe component. Theseenhancements made that messaging
        pattern a first-class way of working. WebSphere MQV7.0.1, in 2009, was primarily an update to improve
        availability and performance.Even though there was nearly a 2 ½ year gap before V7.1 in 2011, there were
        stillincremental improvements. The improvements were to both the core WebSphere MQ productand new products.
        WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition is a solution for the integration of applications that arefile-based,
        making it possible to reliably transfer files between systems. WebSphere MQ FileTransfer Edition provides
        management, monitoring, and security of those transfers.WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition uses existing
        skills and infrastructure as it usesWebSphere MQ as its backbone transfer medium.Advanced Message Security (AMS)
        is a solution to the problem of securing messagecontents, even when those messages are at rest in queues or logs.
        Several regulatoryframeworks require data to be protected from viewing, changing, or being stored on disks inthe
        clear even during processing. One example of these regulations is the Payment CardIndustry (PCI) for dealing
        with credit card data. There are other regulatory bodies for othertypes of data, for example, healthcare, that
        have similar requirements.Both WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition and WebSphere MQ Advanced Message Securityhave
        been integrated into the WebSphere MQ V7.5 package. WebSphere MQ File Transferfunctionally identical but that
        have different licensing terms. The WebSphere MQ Advancedoffering can be ordered under a single part number
        and price and it includes licenses to usethe Managed File Transfer and AMS features. The original V7.5 offering
        has these features asseparately orderable and priced components.Data is transferred between applications in
        messages. A message is a container that consistsof three parts: WebSphere MQ Message Descriptor (MQMD):
        Identifies the message and containsadditional control information. Examples of additional information are the
        type of messageand the priority that is assigned to the message by the sending application. Message properties:
        An optional set of user-definable elements that describes themessage without being part of the payload.
        Applications that receive messages canchoose whether to inspect these properties. Message data: Contains the
        application data. The structure of the data is defined by theapplication programs that use it, and
        WebSphere MQ is largely unconcerned with itsformat or content.The nodes, within a WebSphere MQ message queuing
        infrastructure, are called queuemanagers. The queue manager is responsible for accepting and delivering
        messages.Multiple queue managers can run on a single physical server or on a wide network of serversacross a
        large variety of different hardware and operating system platforms.Each queue manager provides facilities for
        reliable messaging.The queue manager maintains queues of all messages that are waiting to be processed orrouted.
        Queue managers are tolerant of failures and maintain the integrity of business-criticaldata that flows through
        the message queuing infrastructure. In the event of failures, such as afailure of the queue manager, machine
        failures, or a power loss, messages can be recovered.Recovery occurs when the queue manager is restarted and
        any transactions are brought to aconsistent state.The queue managers, within the infrastructure, are connected
        by logical channels over acommunications network. Messages automatically flow across these channels from the
        initialproducer of a message to the eventual consumer of that message based on the configurationof the queue
        managers in the infrastructure. Changes can be made to the configuration ofqueues and channels transparently
        for the applications. For example, a receiving applicationcan be moved to a new machine, and a route to that
        machine can be defined without needingany changes to sending applications.Two applications that must
        communicate, whether hosted on the same machine or separatemachines, might have originally been designed to do
        so directly and synchronously. This wasa common messaging technique that was used before the introduction of
        WebSphere MQand is still used often. For example, using HTTP as a communications protocol is asynchronous
        operation.In the synchronous model, the two applications exchange information by waiting for thepartner
        application to become available and then sending the information. If the partnerapplication is unavailable for
        any reason, including if it is busy communicating with otherapplications, the information cannot be sent.All
        intercommunication failures that can occur between the two applications must beconsidered individually by the
        applications. This consideration happens whether theapplications are on the same machine or on different
        machines that are connected by anetwork. The process requires a protocol for sending the information,
        confirming receipt ofthe information, and sending any subsequent reply.Placing a WebSphere MQ infrastructure
        between the two applications allows thiscommunication to become asynchronous. One application places
        information for the partnerin a message on a queue, and the partner application processes this information
        when it isavailable to do so. If required, it can then send a reply message back to the originator.
        Theapplications do not need to be concerned with communication failures or recovery. A WebSphere MQ client is
        a lightweight component of WebSphere MQ that does not requirethe queue manager runtime code to reside on the
        client system. It enables an application,running on a machine where only the client runtime code is installed,
        to connect to a queuemanager that is running on another machine and perform messaging operations with thatqueue
        manager. Such an application is called a client and the queue manager is referred toas a server.Using a
        WebSphere MQ client is an effective way of implementing WebSphere MQmessaging and queuing. The following
        benefits are available by using a WebSphere MQclient: There is no need for a licensed WebSphere MQ server
        installation on the client machine. Hardware requirements on the client system are reduced. System
        administration requirements on the client system are reduced. An application that uses a WebSphere MQ client
        can connect to multiple queue managerson different machines.There are several implementations of the
        WebSphere MQ client that allow work in differentlanguage environments, including Java and .Net classes. There
        is no client for z/OS. On the z/OS platform, applications can only connect to queue managers within the same

        I want to give you the final spell. But the spells is in the safe and I not know the password anymore.
