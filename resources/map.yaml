      Please, help me. You look like a normal guy to me. I only do this for the money but all those
      followers are only serving me curries in all kind of tastes. And I don't like curries at all.
      And the worst is, it is all vegeterian. They are convinced that I only eat vegeterian curries
      as a soll called enlightend guru.
      Please, can you bring me a decent ductch meal with a good piece of meat?
